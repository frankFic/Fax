A README.md main file describing what the artifact does and where it can be obtained (with hidden links and access password if necessary). Also, there should be a clear description of how to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

# Fax (Fair Android Explorer)
Effective Testing of Android Applications by Constructing Activity Launching Contexts

## Structure:
- Fax
  - Coverage: Coverage result in paper
  - Crashes: Coverage result in paper
  - IntentBench: Self-designed benchmark
  - FaxTool: Runable tool Fax
  
## Requirements:
* Install Java
* Install Ant
* Install Python 2.7
* Fax requires that the Z3 dynamic link library (libz3.so on Unix-like platforms) as well as the dynamic link library for the Z3/Java API (libz3java.so on Unix-like platforms) be in your dynamic library path ($LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix-like platforms; just PATH on Windows).
  * For Windows: copy lib/libz3/libz3.dll and lib/libz3/libz3java.dll to %JAVA_HOME%\bin\.
  * For Unix-like platforms: 
    * add java.library.path into file /etc/profile (export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/[your_library_path]).
    * copy lib/libz3/libz3.so and lib/libz3/libz3java.so to [your_library_path]
    * source /etc/profile
* Prepare Android environment, the version of Android SDK is 17 and the version of Android SDK Tools should lower than 25.2.3.
* Run "java -version", "python", "ant -version", "android create project" to check whether these tools are successfully configured.

## Usage of Fax:
* Prepare an Android device or emulator and connect it to you computer.

* Clone the project to your computer. 

**For quick start, you can run: runFax.sh or runFax.bat**

* Preprocess
Put the apk under test under the [apk_input_dir], and get the result in the [apk_output_dir].
python  script/Prerocess.py  [apk_input_dir]  [apk_output_dir]
e.g., python  script/Prerocess.py  apk  apk_processed
Then the activities will be exposed, the app will be instrumented, and then installed on the device.
For log-in required apps, you can log-in first to improve the exploration coverage.
Do not forge to turn the setting item "developer mode" on and allow "usb debugging".

* Test Generation
python  script/GenerateTestCases.py  lib/Fax0108.jar [apk_input_dir]  [testcase_dir] [execute_info_dir] [max_number_of_path]
e.g., python  script/GenerateTestCases.py  lib/Fax0108.jar  apk Result_testGen  executeInfo 10000 

* Fax Launching Test
python script/LaunchActs.py [testcase_dir]  [launch_dir] 
e.g., python script/LaunchActs.py Result_testGen Result_launch

* Detect Crashes for Fax Launching
python script/FindCrashes.py [testcase_dir]  [launch_dir] 
e.g., python script/FindCrashes.py Result_testGen Result_launch

* Fax Exploration Test
python script/FairAndroidExploer.py [launch_dir]  [explore_dir]  [testcase_dir] [apk_output_dir] [EA/All]
Set EA if you want to set only EA as the exploration entry.
Set All if you want to set all activities as the exploration entry.
e.g., python script/FairAndroidExploer.py Result_launch Result_explore Result_testGen apk_processed ALL

* Detect Crashes for Fax Exploration
python script/FindCrashes.py [testcase_dir]  [explore_dir] 
e.g., python script/FindCrashes.py Result_testGen  Result_explore

* Calculate Coverage Result
python script/CollectLogcat.py  [testcase_dir]  [explore_dir]  [apk_output_dir]
e.g., python script/CollectLogcat.py  Result_testGen  Result_explore apk_processed
