A STATUS.md file stating what kind of badge(s) the authors are applying for as well as the reasons why the authors believe that the artifact deserves that badge(s).

We want to apply for the Available badge. The reasons are as follows:
1) Fax is very carefully documented.
2) Fax is well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. 
3) Fax is placed on a publicly accessible archival repository (TODO).
